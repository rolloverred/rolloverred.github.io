Friends, voting is easier than ever these days! 

The first thing you need to know is that you have to *register to vote*. Whoa. Hold on. Sit down and stay for a minute! It’s not that difficult. I can do this, and I only have eight toes!

This is a state and local thing, right in your own backyard. Some states might have different guidelines than others, but registering is like me chasing a taco truck blindfolded; it’s easy!

**Registering Online**  

If you can get online, [vote.gov](https://vote.gov/) is a great place to start. Online registration is offered in 43 states. 

**A**. Select your state from the list. To find it you can scroll or type in the post office abbreviation: PA if you live in Pennsylvania, KY if you live in Kentucky, and so on. Spell out the full name if you want to show-off.   
**B**. Once you found your state, click the big blue button “Registration or update registration.”  
**C**. From your state’s registration website, fill out the form, submit, then you're registered!  

**Registering In-person**  

There are lots of ways to register in-person. You can sometimes do it on the same day you vote!  But that’s not everywhere, so check to be sure.    

Visit your nearest polling station, election office, town hall, or county court house. You can find a polling station close to you [here](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/).  

A lot of places offer a ‘motor voter’, where people can register at their local department of motor vehicles. Online, you can find what you’ll need to bring with you. The attendants are there to help you every step of the way.  

**Registering from Outside the U.S.**  

If you’re a U.S citizen living, working, or studying abroad, or a member of the military stationed outside the country, go [here](https://vote.gov/voting-outside-of-us) and scroll down to find the Federal Postcard Application (FPCA). You can also request an absentee ballot with the Federal Voting Assistance Program ([FVAP](https://www.fvap.gov/)). 

**Please, Don't Wait to Register!**  

I know voting can be intimidating, but please, please don't ignore or postpone it. My solution for this is the old ‘buddy system’. Grab a friend, relative, or partner to join you—or better yet, have a ‘Voter Registration’ party! Travel as a pack to help, support, and encourage one another.  

It's worth noting something crucial: voting is a privilege we shouldn't take for granted. Fewer than half the people in the whole wide world can cast a truly meaningful vote—one free from manipulation and corruption. We can still have our votes count in this country. But if we don't vote wisely in the coming years, we risk losing that privilege.  

Finally, don’t be afraid. You're registering with your state, not the federal government. If you complete the short form, you’ll be a voter and a proud participant in American democracy in no time.
