Woof! Welcome to everyone and thank you so much for visiting my very own website "Roll Over Red." My name is Blue and I'm a big brown mutt. I guess you could say that I'm really a lot like every human in this world. I'm a giant mix of genes and stuff from here, there, and everywhere. I was born on January 20, 2025, and although I'm still young, I've seen a lot in a very short time. I spent my first months in an animal shelter somewhere deep in a place that they called a "swamp." I was born the runt of the litter, and during that long and lonely stay, I longed to find a home where I could belong. Those months that I slept on a concrete floor were sweltering in the day and very scary and cold at night. The whole area seemed to be crawling with snakes of all kinds. My only real comfort then, was a discarded "Stars and Stripes" beach towel that served as both my companion and blanket. When finally, on that long awaited day when my cage door swung open and I was adopted, I grabbed my "flag" off that filthy floor and I carried it with me to my new forever home.

Today, I'm a lot bigger and much stronger, but best of all, I am finally free! Sadly though, I'm still very frightened of this world that I see around me. There's hate, bigotry, bullying, and injustice everywhere I look, and I just can't ignore it any longer! We dogs love to have a job to do, and now, I know I've found mine.

The heart that you see on my chest shows my love and compassion that I carry for everyone. "Roll Over Red" is my banner. It says that I am done with the extreme right's politics and its kneeling subservient leaders with their constant lies and disdain for the weakest among us. I want to help lead the Democratic Party in all 50 states to victories in every future local, state, and national election. I'll do that along with your help while running ahead into the future and toppling over the far right's symbols and "dog whistles" of hate and ignorance. Furthermore, I will not stop running until these extremists are all kicked out of office and dumped into the dustpans of our nation's history.

It will be a difficult run to the mid-term elections and 2028, so I invite everyone who also feels lost and forgotten to run along beside me. With "We Are Going Ahead" (WAGA), we've flipped their message to embrace everyone whose community and families have been callously and sometimes violently dismissed and even preyed upon.

Oh! You may have noticed that I decided to wear my old "flag"! Yes, it's tattered, soiled, and even bloodied, but it's still very much mine and it's still yours, too! Long may it wave for the tired and poor and those "yearning to breathe free"... (I saw a picture on my family's wall of a green lady in a bathrobe saying that!). I invite everyone to run with me regardless of your faith, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, personal capabilities, or nationality. Yes, it's going to be uphill, and some of us will fall down along the way. But together, we can help one another up and run out of darkness and zoom ahead into the sunshine. Please run with me and for this country that you love and that its founders only once dreamed. No matter how long or "ruff" this road will be, we will only get there together as one. Let's go now and... let's go Blue!
