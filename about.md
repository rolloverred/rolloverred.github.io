### Our Story
A handful of friends gathered in late January of 2025. Worried for their nation’s future, they decided to help defend their country’s founding principles in a way only they could. 

They were educators, storytellers, and concerned citizens. All happened to be rescue dog owners. 

Dogs are special. They simplify life and show us what really matters. No matter what is going on, a happy dog can put our worries at ease. If only a dog could show people what matters in politics. 

“That’s it!”, they thought. Let’s show everyone the state of politics from the perspective of a dog.

Then came Blue. This pup isn’t happy just chasing balls. He wants to unify Americans around better leaders. He warmly welcomes all those who feel lost, forgotten, or betrayed to vote for the Democratic Party in 2026. 

### Our Mission
We're on a crusade to unite voters behind better leaders. We deserve politicians who champion honest dialogue, compassion, justice, and policies that work for everyone.
